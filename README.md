A Pong game built in **C++** using **Raylib** with an AI-controlled opponent that automatically tracks and returns the ball. Focuses on game loop design, physics-based collision, and object-oriented structure.

The project focuses on game logic, object-oriented design, and real-time input handling. It helped me understand how game loops, collision detection, and object interactions work in a structured way.

## 🚀 Features

- 🏓 Smooth paddle movement  
- ⚽ Ball physics with bouncing mechanics  
- 🎯 Collision detection between ball and paddles  
- 🧠 Simple game loop structure  
- 🏆 Score tracking system  
- 🔄 Restart functionality

## 🧠 Design / OOP Overview

| Concept | How I Applied It |
|:--------|:-----------------|
| **Abstraction** | Game elements (ball, paddles, game loop) are separated into logical parts |
| **Encapsulation** | Position, speed, and score are managed inside objects |
| **Modularity** | Code is structured into separate components/functions |
| **Game Loop Design**| Continuous update-render cycle for real-time gameplay |

## 📌 Why I Built This

This project was my way of understanding how simple games are actually structured behind the scenes. 

While building it, I started to see how movement, collision, and object interaction all depend on a clean game loop. It also helped me get more comfortable with C++ OOP design and thinking in terms of objects instead of just functions.
